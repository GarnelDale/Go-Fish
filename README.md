# Overview
This is a single player Go Fish game with a, admittedly unintelligent, CPU opponent using a standard 52 playing card deck. 

A number of developers I know spoke highly of Rust so I made this program to learn about the language and how it differs from the others I know (C++ and Python). Learning the difference in structure between C++ and Rust was a major part of this project.

* [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
* [Rust Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/)

# Future Work
* Improve the AI card request to not only go in order of face value.
* Improve the console output to be easier to look at.
* Change the ask function to allow the user to use Ace, Jack, Queen, and King as commands instead of the associated numbers.
